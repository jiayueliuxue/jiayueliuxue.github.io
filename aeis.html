			<h1>AEIS</h1>
			
			<h2>What is AEIS</h2>
			
			The Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS) is a centralised admissions exercise conducted by MOE around September or October each year for new international students who wish to join our mainstream primary and secondary schools in January of the following year.
			AEIS consists of a centralised test on English and Mathematics that will assess the applicants’ English literacy, numeracy and reasoning abilities. Applicants who pass the test will be offered a place in a suitable school, based on availability of school vacancies, their test performance and declared address in Singapore.
			International students seeking admission to mainstream schools in Singapore should note that English is the medium of instruction and are strongly encouraged to prepare themselves before sitting for the AEIS tests. They should be familiar with the English and Mathematics syllabi of the level preceding the one they are applying for.
			
			<h2>Who is AEIS for</h2>
			New international students who do not have a place in a local school and who wish to seek admission into Primary 2–5 and Secondary 1–3 levels in January of the following academic year are eligible to take part in AEIS.

			<h2>O and A Level Preparation Courses</h2>

			It has long been noted that education has always been instrumental in the growth and development of Singapore, particularly in the years following 1965 when it became an independent republic.  International students who are studying in Singapore have the opportunity to be connected to an education system that promotes excellence and be part of a progressive cosmopolitan community.
			Singapore’s institutions and universities have a distinctive record of high standards in teaching and learning. Singapore current attracts over 60,000 international students from around the world. The presence of such an international mix of students provides a rich exchange of culture while maintaining a high quality and rigorous education system.
